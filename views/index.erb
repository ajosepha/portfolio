			<p>I recently graduated from the Flatiron School's first NYC Web Development Fellowship in Brooklyn, NY.  Before moving to New York last year,
		 	I spent two years living in Paris where I got a Master’s in 
		 	French Cultural Studies in a Global Context from Columbia 
		 	University and worked as a consultant at Image 7,
		 	a financial PR firm. I’m fascinated by the intersection of 
		 	technology and humanities. I graduated from Brown with a degree
		  	in Classics.</p>
