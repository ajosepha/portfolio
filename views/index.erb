	<h1>Welcome to Ariel's Portfolio</h1>
	<p>I’m a student at the Flatiron School, learning to become 
	a full-stack developer.  Before moving to New York last year,
 	I spent two years living in Paris where I got a Master’s in 
 	French Cultural Studies in a Global Context from Columbia 
 	University and worked as a consultant at Image 7,
 	a financial PR firm. I’m fascinated by the intersection of 
 	technology and humanities. I graduated from Brown with a degree
  	in Classics.</p>
